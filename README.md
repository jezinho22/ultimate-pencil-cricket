# Ultimate pencil cricket - an Excel spreadsheet
## A cricket simulation for Bowla, who enjoys a game of pencil cricket
Pencil cricket involves a hexagonal-section pencil, with cricket outcomes written onto each side - 0, 1, 1, 4, 6, Out. And then some more outcomes for how out: caught, bowled, lbw, run out, not out, not out. So the chance of actually being out is 1/6 * 1/3 ie 1 in 18. Naturally you can choose your teams however you want.
This spreadsheet based version takes it to the extremes of a full two innings, and test-match-like scoring. You can choose your team, and allocate points for batting and for bowling strengths - and make this fair by having a limited total number of points to use for the team.
The main version of the game is Excel-based as this allowed the creation of the scoreboard and also a way to give Bowla the game so he could actually play it.

It's too slow, really. It needs a 20-20 version, and at most a one day version, with more batting risk and reward.
